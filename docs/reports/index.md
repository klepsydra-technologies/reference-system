# Reference system reports

Eventually this page will hold CI-run benchmarks that are updated regularly.

Still a work in progress but please check back soon.

### Disclaimer regarding the reports

The reports hosted here are ran on a vanilla Ubuntu CI system and should not be taken as
the true performance of the system if it was running on a real-time embedded system. They are
meant as a rough approximation for anyone looking for some quick data.

For reports actually ran on a real-time benchmark system please see
[the ROS 2 real-time benchmarks](https://ros-realtime.github.io/ros2_realtime_benchmarks/) site.

If neither of the above solutions are appropriate run the reference system manually on the desired
platform and generate the reports [following the instructions](../the-autoware-reference-system.md).
